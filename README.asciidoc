Commentary
----------

Wiki is a hypertext and a content management system: Normal users are
encouraged to enhance the hypertext by editing and refactoring
existing pages and by adding more pages.  This is made easy by
requiring a certain way of writing pages.  It is not as complicated as
a markup language such as HTML.  The general idea is to write plain
ASCII.  Word with mixed case such as ThisOne are WikiNames -- they may
be a Link or they may not.  If they are, clicking them will take you
to the page with that WikiName; if they are not, clicking them will
create an empty page for you to fill out.

This mode takes those concepts and applies them in a slightly
different way. That is, it lets some other ascii based documentation
mode handle the updating and generation, but adds the important
concepts of wiki linking and opening documents on top of those other
major modes. To get this additional functionality, simply add

[source, lisp]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (require 'wiki)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will activate WdocMode for all files in `wdoc-directories' as
soon as they are opened.  This works by adding `wdoc-maybe' to
`find-file-hooks'.
What about a Major Mode?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, wdoc files will be in `fundamental-mode'.  I prefer to be
in `text-mode', instead.  You can do this either for all files that
have WikiNames by changing `auto-mode-alist', or you can make
text-mode the default mode instead of fundamental mode.  Example

[source,lisp]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (setq default-major-mode 'text-mode)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This puts wdoc files in `text-mode'.  One problem remains, however.
Text mode usually means that the apostrophe is considered to be part
of words, and some WikiNames will not be highlighted correctly, such
as "WikiName''''s".  In that case, change the syntax table, if you
don't mind the side effects.  Example

[source,lisp]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (modify-syntax-entry ?' "." text-mode-syntax-table)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
